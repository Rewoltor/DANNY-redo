# FeelGood (React)

This repository is a migrated Next.js app converted to a Vite + React application.

How to run:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The `pages/` dir from Next was converted into `src/pages/` and routing is handled with `react-router-dom`.
- Tailwind is still used; if you need Tailwind processing, ensure `tailwind.config.js` is present and `postcss` is configured.
